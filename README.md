This is a simple implementation of classification of the Iris dataset using Accord.NET and visualization using Avalonia.

Here I used a multilayer neural network and the backpropagation learning algorithm, also known as a multilayer perceptron.

The plot shows the epoch error values, it is possible to change the number of layers, neurons in them and some training parameters. You can also view information about each neuron during/after training and run a test classification with your data.

This is my university work, nothing more.
